    - *Expected*: Your station (e.g., Dam Nation) and role should be displayed correctly.
3.  **Check-In**: Tap the **"Confirm & Check In"** button.

## 3. Stress Test (The "Break-it" List)
We need you to try and "break" the app so we can fix it before the actual race day. Try these actions:

- **Double Tapping**: Tap the Check-In button multiple times rapidly.
- **Bad Signal**: Try searching while walking away from your WiFi/Cell signal to see how it handles loading.
- **Rapid Navigation**: Enter your name, go back, and enter it again quickly.
- **Double Check-In**: Try finding your name again after a successful check-in and see if it allows another check-in.

## 4. Feedback Form (Required)
Please provide the following feedback to the Lead Volunteer:

1.  **Speed**: Did the name search feel instant or laggy?
2.  **Clarity**: Was it obvious what you needed to click to finish your check-in?
3.  **Visuals**: Did anything look "broken" or cut off on your phone screen?
4.  **Signal**: Did you experience any "Network Error" messages?
5.  **Rating**: on a scale of 1-5, how much easier is this than the old paper rosters?
