## 🔄 WORKFLOW CHECKPOINTS & RECOVERY

### What Triggers Checkpoints

Antigravity pauses at end of each stage:

```
Stage 1 → Checkpoint: "Research Complete"
         Display findings
         Wait for user approval
         ↓
Stage 2 → Checkpoint: "Architecture Approved"
         Show diagram
         Wait for user approval
         ↓
Stage 3 → Checkpoint: "Build Complete"
         Show results & metrics
         Automatic → Continue to Stage 4 (or ask for review)
         ↓
Stage 4 → Checkpoint: "Ready for Beta"
         Show metrics & deployment plan
         Wait for deployment approval
         ↓
Stage 5 → Checkpoint: "Live & Monitoring"
         Show live URLs
         Start collecting feedback
```

### When Workflow Stops

If any stage fails or stops:

```
Example: Stage 3 Build encounters error

Portal displays:
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⚠️  Stage 3 Paused - Action Needed │
├────────────────────────────────────┤

└────────────────────────────────────┘

Portal also shows:
- Detailed error logs
- Previous successful steps
- What needs to be fixed
- One-click resume button
- Contact support option
```

### Resume Logic

When user clicks "Resume":

```
1. Antigravity reviews what completed
2. Identifies failure point
3. Attempts fix or asks for input
4. Re-runs failed component
5. Updates portal with progress
6. Continues to next stage on success
```

## 🤖 AGENT SWARM COORDINATION

### How Agents Work Together

**Stage 2 Planning Example**:

```
User approves research → Stage 2 starts

Antigravity orchestrates:

1. @architect agent
   Prompt: "Design system architecture for [project]
            Based on research: [findings]
            Tech stack: [stack]"
   Output: Architecture diagram + spec

2. @database agent
   Prompt: "Design database schema for [project]
            Based on architecture: [diagram]"
   Output: SQL schema + relationships

3. @frontend agent
   Prompt: "Design component structure for [project]
            Based on architecture: [diagram]
            Using shadcn/ui components"
   Output: Component tree + structure

4. Agents reference each other:
   @frontend: "Based on @database schema..."
   @backend: "Following @architect diagram..."
   
5. Improver Agent:
   Prompt: "Review architecture, database, frontend
            Identify any gaps or improvements"
   Output: Optimization suggestions

6. Results combined into:
   - Unified architecture document
   - Integrated schema
   - Complete system design
```

### Stage 3 Build Orchestration

```
@builder agent starts parallel tasks:

Task 1: Backend API
├─ Create routes
├─ Setup models
├─ Add validation
└─ Create tests

Task 2: Frontend
├─ Create components
├─ Setup state
├─ Add styling
└─ Create tests

Task 3: Database
├─ Create tables
├─ Setup migrations
├─ Create indexes
└─ Create seeds

Task 4: Authentication
├─ Google OAuth setup
├─ Token management
├─ Permission system
└─ Tests

As each task progresses:
- @tester runs tests immediately
- Issues auto-created
- @improver suggests optimizations
- @monitor tracks progress
- Portal updates in real-time
```
